1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The boy didn't like looking people in the eye.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He wasn't trying to be mean.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It just made him feel uncomfortable.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sometimes, he would flap his arms again and again.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One day, I found out I have something called autism.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My family got me help.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Slowly, I found my voice.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And learned all the way, I could live with it better.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Early intervention can make a lifetime of difference.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
